## Previously... (publication is based on these previous experiments)

Did you know you can sort faster than [quick sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) - [C++ sort implementation in O(n log(n))](https://cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/sort/)?

This code was written just to inspire, not to be a production code... And there is even way better way (why to sort when you know where things approximately belong?) to do it (without using quicksort)...

Quick sort takes around ~20.262 seconds, "statistical" sorting took only ~12.487 seconds with [AMD Ryzenâ„¢ 7 8845HS](https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/laptop/ryzen/8000-series/amd-ryzen-7-8845hs.html) on [linux](https://kernel.org/) on a [Lenovo](https://www.lenovo.com/) [IdeaPad](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/c/laptops/ideapad/)... And if you use multi-threading, it can get to ~4.415 seconds on 16-threads already mentioned AMD processor.

Simple idea behind this code for single-threaded execution is O(n log n) > O(n log (n/m)) = O(m (n/m log(n/m))). (Yes, if you do a great job without quicksort you can get close to O(n)...)

main_statsort.cpp is a bit improved implementation, which can be further improved?

quicksort ~ 21.478s

stat sort ~ 13.198s

stat sort multi threaded ~ 3.331s
