# Statistical Sorting

Did you know you can sort faster than [quick sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)?

This code was written just to inspire, not be a production code... And there is even way better way to do it...

Quick sort takes around ~30 seconds, "statistical" sorting took only ~7 seconds...
